        <p id="para1"> Thanks for coming to my site. I'm Madison! I grew up right outside of philly. My father owned his own restaraunt since the year I was born. 
        It was a small place that had Cajun/Creole quisine, and some of your traditional american goods. I was lucky enough to be able to try different foods from various cultures.
    Food has become super special in my life. Baking and cooking myself are two of my favorite hobbies. It's even better when I get to try someone else's. I enjoy to hike, swim, travel, camp, and a whole lot more.
I also just love being at home with my litle family doing absolutely nothing. I want my page to be personal, and I hope that you can find comfort in learning about all of the different types of food I try.  </p>
