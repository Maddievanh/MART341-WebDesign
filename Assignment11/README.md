Continuing assignment 10 website- index.html and about.html

                Create a page with an external CSS style sheet

                Add hover effects to enhance interactivity

- I added my hover effect to my h3 text so when it was clicked on, it not onky changes color and fonts but is also a link. 

                Use an external font that is self-hosted

Used "magical style sans serif" and downloaded it to my own computer then used the font face element to add it onto my page.

                Use an external font from a font library
I downloaded two fonts from google fonts to make my site have a more stylish heading but the rest of the text is meant to be playful. 

Experiment with different font styles
- Used font styles to change the appearance when you hover over my link on my page. 

Adjust font-weight for emphasis
- I adjusted my header to have a higher font weight so that it sticks out because the font is originally very thin. 

text decoration

- I used text decoration to remove underlines from my nav bar and from my link to the gallery page.
