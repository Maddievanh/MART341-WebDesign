            <h3><u>Nice to meet you!</u></h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Madison Van Horn. I have always loved baking 
                but have really got to test my skills the last few years.
            I believe that baking is important in all of our lives. Whether it is sharing with others
            or baking for yourself, baking is one of the biggest comforts that I believe humans can have. 
            I own 2 cats, Mika and Malikai. They are my favorite beings in the world. We even do some special cooking
            for them too! I live at homr with my partner of 8 years and we could not be happier to have
            settled in Missoula.
            </p>

      <h3><u>How I started baking</u></h3>
      <p> I began baking once I moved out from Pennsylvania across the country to Montana. I was lucky enough to have
          my great friends here, but I was by myself for many months. Once the holidays started rolling around I felt 
          the typical holiday blues. This time around, I had no family. It is extremely expensive to fly to and from Montana, 
          so it is rare I get to be with family for all of the holidays. I really fell in love with cooking when I moved out. My dad has been a cheg
          and owned a restaurant since I was born. It wasn't until thanksgiving rolled around that I realized the love I had for baking. 
          Baking felt so intimate compared to cooking. I made my very first apple strudel! I was expecting it to be horrible, but it became my all time favorite 
          dessert. I make it more than anything else. Nastolgia typically comes from childhood, but this dessert is nastolgic to me because of how special it became.
          I am so happy to share this recipe with everyone.
