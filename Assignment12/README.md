                    Border – 
                I used a few different borders around my header (nav bar), my text, and for the drop down. The borders all have similar uses, I was able to style them and color which works to seperate different sections / create a seemless design. 

                    Margin – 
                 I used margin many times, I used it to make space between my elements so that they look uniform and things are spaced apart. 

                    Padding – 
                I used padding many times, it was used to make space between text and borders.  

                    Display
                The display block/hover element was used for the header in order to make the drop down menu drop downwards and be able to use your mouse to hover. I also used display none so that my drop down menu was not displayed unless hovered over. 

                    Dropdown – 
                I made a dropdown bar in my header using the display property. I wanted my site to have something to interact with outside of just clicking page to page. 
                    
                    Position – 
                For my dropdown bar, I used absolute positioning to make sure when the drop down bar was clicked, it would drob below the header instead of within it.
