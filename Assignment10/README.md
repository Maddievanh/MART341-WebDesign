1. class selector: 
I used multiple class selectors to apply specific attributes to a group of elements. For example, I needed my three images at the top to align horizontally. They also all needed a border with an opaque color. 
2. ID selector
My ID selector is my first paragraph on my page. I used the ID selector because the paragraph stands alone, but I applied different elements to it so it could be differentiated from my "h3" element. 

3 additional techniques: 

1. diff background colors/ font colors: 
I used multiple different background colors. My photoshave a lighter purple with opacity, my background is a very light purple, and my sewarch bar is a dark purple (in order for it to stand out). I also used different font colors. I stuck with dark purple and balck so they are easy to read but they follow the color theme. 

2. diff opacities: I used differnt opacities to apply to my first block as well as the borders around my images. The opacity gives my webpage some contrast so it is not all one cohesive color. 

3. borders: My borders wrapped around my images, as previously stated this gave the site some balance and contrast.
