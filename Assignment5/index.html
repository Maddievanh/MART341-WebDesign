                    <h3>Small Business site</h3>
                        <p>For my small business site I would sell my handmade wired jewelry. This site would have a calming, friendly tone with earthy colors.</p>

                     <h3>Travel Journal</h3>
                       <p>For my travel journal, I would document all of the national parks I have visited and give tips and ideas for fellow travelers. The tone for this site would be friendly, amusing, and have a colorful palette. </p>

                    <h3>Personal Blog</h3>
                     <p>For my own personal blog I would talk about SFX makeup. Products I use, tutorials, etc. For this site I would want it to feel spooky, dark, and have dark colors. </p>
