how i used them in my assignment

    Div (at least 2)
    I used the Div tag to group together my entire image gallery, for my audio styling, and media. 
    I also used the Div tag for individual pictures in the gallery.

    Span (at least 2)
    I used span on each gallery photo description to highlight words that will excite the viewer for the look. 

    Audio (at least 1)
    I used a very halloween/low vibration audio so anyone on the website can enjoy some music while browsing. 

    Video (at least 1)
    My video is my header. it is the first thing viewed on the page and ties in the whole aesthetic. At first I wanted something smaller but I liked how this looked better. 

    Iframe (at least 1)
    I originally was going to link an instagram account until i realized it is not iframe friendly. So instead I linked a site to one of my favorite makeup brands to buy SFX products from. 

    Class (at least 2)

    I used the class attribute to each gallery photo, audio section, and media section so they can all have their own individual styling. 

    Escape character (at least 1)
 I used the copyright escape character (thanks for the idea!) to use in my footer.
