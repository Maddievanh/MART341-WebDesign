<p>Hi! My name is Madison Van Horn. I have always loved baking 
    but have really got to test my skills the last few years.
I believe that baking is important in all of our lives. Whether it is sharing with others
or baking for yourself, baking is one of the biggest comforts that I believe humans can have. 
</p>



    

<h2> How I started baking</h2>
<p> I began baking once I moved out from Pennsylvania across the country to Montana. I was lucky enough to have
    my great friends here, but I was by myself for many months. Once the holidays started rolling around I felt 
    the typical holiday blues. This time around, I had no family. It is extremely expensive to fly to and from Montana, 
    so it is rare I get to be with family for all of the holidays. I really fell in love with cooking when I moved out. My dad has been a cheg
    and owned a restaurant since I was born. It wasn't until thanksgiving rolled around that I realized the love I had for baking. 
    Baking felt so intimate compared to cooking. I made my very first apple strudel! I was expecting it to be horrible, but it became my all time favorite 
    dessert. I make it more than anything else. Nastolgia typically comes from childhood, but this dessert is nastolgic to me because of how special it became.
    I am so happy to share this recipe with everyone.
