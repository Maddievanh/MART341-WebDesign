Materials needed:
- Sheet pan
- Wax or parchement paper
- Medium to large pan
- Rolling pin 

For strudel: 
- Puff pastry sheets (2 come in 1 pack)
- 5 Apples (Granny and honey crisp, but may use any you would like)
- 1 large tsp Cinnamon 
- 4 tbs Butter (unsalted)
- 3 tsp Corn startch
- 1/2 cup brown sugar (dark or light)
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 tsp salt 

For egg wash: 
1 egg, 1-2 tablespoon water

Can add any other additions. Such as cranberries, raisins, orange zest, nuts, etc. 

Icing: 
- 1 cup powdered sigar
- 1/2 cup salted butter, room temp
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- 2-3 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup heavy cream (or whole milk). But put in small amounts at a time if you want a thicker texture. 

Instructions:
(puff pastry needs to be set out of freezer. It still needs to be cold but soft enough to shape. )

1. Begin by preheating your oven to 400F. 

2. Start with making your filling. Peel and cube all of your apples into a large bowl. Make the apple cube slices to your liking!

3. Put your 4 tbs butter into the pan, turn heat to medium high. 5-7 on numbered oven. 

4. Once butter is melted, transfer your apples to the pan. 

5. immediately toss in your 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulatred sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1 tsp cinnamon. 
mix, and add your cornstarch. 

6. This is a quick process! as the apples start to release their juices immediately remove from heat. If left on the heat too long the jucie will be runny and the apples will be too soft. 

7. As the filling cools, prepare your work space. Take flour on a large clean surface and sprinkle it ovet this space. 

8. Take your puff pastry sheet and lay it flat on top of your flowered surface. 

9. Roll it out with your rolling pin. stretching the pastry. Thickness depends on the person, but I make mine decently thin. 

10. Take the puff pastry and lay it on top of a wax/parchament paper lined sheet pan. 

11. Now put your filling on top of the pastry. Try to keep it in the middle of the pastry, as it will move and ooze while baking in the oven, and to leave space to attatch the braided pieces to the sides. 

12. Now, we are going to braid it!
(it is optional to do this, you may also lay your second pastry in the package as a top piece, or stretch your original dough to fold over however you like. I also recommend just making large slits on top if you do not want to braid.

13. As shown in the video, make sure to brush the edges of your pastry (or pastry pieces) and pinch or use a fork to seal the edges. Brush the egg wash on top of your pastry as well.

14. Transfer into oven, cook for 10-20 minutes. Make icing while you wait. 

ICING INSTRUCTIONS:
electric mixer recommended. 
1. Put your butter into a mixing bowl.
2. add powdered sugar. 
3. add vanilla extract
4. add heavy cream as needed. 

------------------ 

15. Once taken out, you can add your icing now or individually. if icing turns out with powdered sugar clumps, putting it into the microwave for 10-15 seconds and stirring can help break them up. 

16. Enjoy your delicious strudel!
