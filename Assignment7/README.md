I am proud of how the images came out because this was honestly what took the longest for me. I struggle with placing images where they look correct and that is something I hope we dive more into! I did some research but what I found did not exactly fix what I was trying to do. I also like my color choices, I want it to be in the halloween spirit and it definitely does but still is easy to read with the dark to light contrast. I also think the checklist is perfect for this kind of site. I would never want to target people who can afford more than others, finding similar dupes to higher end makeup is the fun part. I would like to do some more searching to see how I can align everything better. Putting everything in the right spots is something I struggle with.
