I chose my SFXC personal blog to further develop. I still love and enjoy SFX makeip and have the most knowledge in it. I want this site to feel dark but also friendly. 


I applied the balance concepts we learned this week by focusing on symmetry. I wanted my site to be clean cut and easy to follow. I wanted a darker feel but still wanted the text to be easy to look at, so I went with a light grey for the background with dark black/red text so it has the "dark" vibe while still being easy to read.

I definitly think I did exactly what I was expecting for a simple site. It did take somr adjustments to get the exact tone I was searching for. I played with different colors and placement and believe it turned out good.  


Additionally, reflect on any challenges you faced during this assignment and how you overcame them. Did you encounter any issues with balancing content or using CSS? How did you solve them?

I did have a hard time at first, but once I started using things multiple times and checking my page in my browser, my brain was finally able to recognize the code much easier. I was able to use the same semantic markups more than once and remembered how to do them with no reference, which is a huge win for me! Having my own site to reference every time I made a simple page was super helpful, and the HTML reference page.
